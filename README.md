
# Overview

This is the classic Liar's dice game written in Python. This code allows for multiple players to play liar's dice at once on one computer by using a popup window to show the contents of the player's cup.
This also uses a game loop to continue playing until there is a winner.
The purpose of this software is to be used as base code to be rewritten for mobile application.
